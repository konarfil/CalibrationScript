# A configuration file with parameters for the calibration algorithm
# gas_pressure - total tracking gas pressure in bars
# He_pressure - partial pressure of helium (from 0 to 1)
# Et_pressure - partial pressure of ethanol (from 0 to 1)
# Ar_pressure - partial pressure of argon (from 0 to 1)
# T_gas - temperature of the tracking gas in Kelvin
# minimization_threshold - loss function threshold to end the minimization algorithm in keV
# max_iterations - maximum number of iterations of the minimization algorithm
# min_hits - minimum number of detected electrons for an OM to be considered for the calibration

# He_pressure + Et_pressure + Ar_pressure should be equal to 1
# if the minimization algorithm converges in less than max_iterations then each of the two peaks
# in the calibration spectrum is closer then sqrt(minimization_threshold) keV to the correct energy
